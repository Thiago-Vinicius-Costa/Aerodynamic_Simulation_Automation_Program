Introduction
----------------------------------
The Aerodynamic Simulation Automation Program is a tool developed in Python that allows interaction with OpenFOAM to perform aerodynamic simulations of 4-digit Naca profiles. With an intuitive graphical interface, the program simplifies the process of configuring and running simulations, making it ideal for aeromodeling competition teams, profile studies, and beginners with OpenFOAM.

Initial Screen
----------------------------------
The program's initial screen presents fields for entering essential data to start a simulation:

-- Naca Points File: Where the user can load a file containing the Naca profile points.
-- Naca and Study Angles: Fields to enter the Naca profile code (e.g., "0012") and the angles to be studied (e.g., "0, 1, 2.5").
-- Mesh Options: Allows the user to choose between a standard mesh validated for Naca 0012 or a custom mesh for compressible cases.
-- Simulation Configuration: Including the choice between compressible or incompressible and setting variables such as velocity in m/s, kinematic viscosity (nu), nut (recommended same as nu value), and nutilda (recommended 4 times the nu value).

Simulation Execution
----------------------------------
After configuring all necessary parameters, the user can click on "Run Simulation" to start the simulation process. The program will create a file for each specified angle and initialize them sequentially. The results will be grouped at the end of the process.

Error Messages
----------------------------------
The program provides error messages to assist users in case of invalid inputs or problems during execution:

-- Error in Angles: If the specified angles are incorrect or not entered correctly, the program will display an error message indicating the necessary correction.
-- OpenFOAM in Use: If OpenFOAM is in use by another process, the system itself will notify the user about the impossibility of starting a new simulation until OpenFOAM is available.
-- Open Excel File: When performing simulations sequentially and generating results files in Excel format, it is important to ensure that these files are not open during the compilation of results, as this may cause errors in the operation.

Mesh Modification
----------------------------------
The program offers extensive flexibility in modifying mesh parameters. Users can adjust the following criteria to optimize the mesh according to the specific needs of each simulation:

-- Distances relative to the inlet and outlet points
-- Sizes of cells at the leading edge, trailing edge, and middle
-- Position of the separation point
-- Thicknesses of layers at the boundary and the first layer
-- Maximum cell sizes at the inlets, outlets, and the junction between inlet and outlet
-- Number of divisions in and out the boundary layer, at the tail, at the leading edge, and the trailing edge

The tail angle is adjusted according to the angle of attack to better capture the effects downstream of the aerodynamic profile.

Installation
----------------------------------
The program installation can be done through GitHub at https://github.com/Thiago-Vinicius-Costa/Aerodynamic-Simulation-Automatiov1n-Program.git, where the source code and a README file explaining the installation process and system requirements are available. The GitHub repository link will be provided to facilitate user access.

Documentation
----------------------------------
The code of the Aerodynamic Simulation Automation Program was developed as part of the developer's undergraduate thesis. In the GitHub repository, users will find the final document of the thesis, which includes detailed information about the methodology used, software documentation, and obtained results. This document serves as an additional source of information for users interested in understanding the operation and objectives of the program.
